                <h2>Access and Use of the Service</h2>
                
                <h3>Service Description</h3>
                <p>The Service is designed to provide AI-powered clinical scenario simulation for OB-GYN residents, fellows, and attendings to help prepare for annual oral board examinations. The Service uses artificial intelligence to create realistic clinical scenarios similar to those that may be encountered during oral board examinations, and provides feedback and guidance to help users develop critical thinking and examination skills.</p>

                <h3>No Guarantee of Examination Success</h3>
                <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: USE OF THE SERVICE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL PASS YOUR OBGYN ORAL BOARDS EXAMINATION OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL EXAMINATION. Our Service is designed to help you prepare, but success ultimately depends on many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to your individual preparation, knowledge base, clinical experience, exam day performance, and the specific content of your examination. While we strive to create realistic simulation scenarios that may be helpful in preparation, passing any examination ultimately depends on your own knowledge, skills, and preparation. EmpowerMedAI makes no warranties, representations, or guarantees that use of the Service will result in passing any examination.</p>

You may be required to select a subscription plan and provide information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to EmpowerMedAI that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument and, if applicable, to charge your method of payment on a periodic basis until you terminate your subscription. You will promptly update your account information with EmpowerMedAI or the Payment Processor (as defined below), as applicable, of any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay EmpowerMedAI the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms of Use. If your payment plan includes an ongoing subscription that is automatically renewed periodically, you hereby authorize EmpowerMedAI (through the Payment Processor) to charge your payment instrument on such periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your subscription, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. You must cancel at least one day before the next subscription renewal date to avoid being charged for the renewal period.</p>

                <p>If you believe your account is charged incorrectly, reach out to EmpowerMedAI immediately, and EmpowerMedAI will refund you if the charge was processed in error. If you dispute any charges with the issuer of your payment method, you must let EmpowerMedAI know within sixty (60) days after the date that EmpowerMedAI charges you, or within such longer period of time as may be required under applicable law. We reserve the right to change EmpowerMedAI's prices. If EmpowerMedAI does change prices for an ongoing subscription, EmpowerMedAI will provide notice of the change through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means, at EmpowerMedAI's option, at least thirty (30) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on EmpowerMedAI's net income. In the event of non-payment of any amounts due, EmpowerMedAI will be entitled to recoup all of its costs of collection allowed by law, including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs, and interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum allowed by law.</p>

                <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding any amounts owed to EmpowerMedAI hereunder, EMPOWERMEDAI DOES NOT PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To facilitate payment for the Services via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use third-party payment processors (collectively, "Payment Processors"). These payment processing services are provided by the Payment Processors and are subject to the applicable Payment Processor's terms and conditions, privacy policy, and all other relevant agreements (collectively, the "Payment Processor Agreements"). By agreeing to these Terms of Use, Users that use the payment functions of the Services also agree to be and are hereby bound by the applicable Payment Processor Agreement for the payment function the User is using, as the same may be modified by the applicable Payment Processor from time to time. You hereby authorize the applicable Payment Processor to store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of the Service. Please contact the applicable Payment Processor for more information. EmpowerMedAI assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Services.</p>
